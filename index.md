Hello, welcome to my website! 

My name's Nikhil and I'm a software engineer living in the Bay Area.
I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2017, then worked at a [self driving car startup](https://www.drive.ai),
and am currently working on autonomous systems at Apple.

For now I've set up this website just to claim my digital land, but in the future I may use it to blog and share thoughts.

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk by emailing me at nikhil@\<this domain>.
