Hello, welcome to my website! 

My name's Nikhil and I'm a software engineer living in the Bay Area.
I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2017 and afterwards worked at a [self driving car startup](https://www.drive.ai).

For now I've set up this website just to claim my digital land, but in the future I may use it to blog and share ideas :).

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to talk at \<my first name>@\<this domain>!
