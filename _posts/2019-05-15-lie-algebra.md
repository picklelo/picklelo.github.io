# Lie Group
A Lie Group is simply a group that is also a differentiable manifold.
Examples of Lie Groups are the set of $n \times n$ invertible matrices, 
denoted by $GL(N)$. A Lie group has associated with it a Lie Algebra
$\mathscr{g}$. By converting back and forth between the two representations, we can simplify and solve many problems.

Consider a topological space $T$. We say this space is differentiable if
for each point $t \in T$, the derivative $\nabla T$ exists at the point $t$.

If i make th is longer, the issue should be solved
